# Catalan Verb Trainer
A tool to train conjugating Catalan verbs.
I started to create this tool as I noticed that studying conjugations of verbs from a textbook doesn't make sure you are ready to use them in conversation.
The main problem is that you learn them in a certain order: 1st, 2nd, 3rd person singular and then 1st, 2nd, 3rd person plural.
In conversation you need to know a specific conjugation on the spot, without mentally going through: "parlo parles parla parlem parleu parlen" before knowing the 3rd person plural of "parlar".
